This section outlines the projects I've worked on as part of my ICT studies. 

## [IV1350 Object-Oriented Design Project](https://github.com/danaghafour/iv1350)

The course involved developing a single object-oriented program, reported in five different seminars, with each focusing on a distinct aspect of software development. Below is a summary of the project tasks for each seminar and a link to the repository where the project is hosted.

### Seminar 1: Analysis
- **Summary**: This seminar focused on creating a domain model and a system sequence diagram based on given specifications. It aimed at interpreting and clarifying a given specification by applying established guidelines for analysis.
- **Learning Outcome**: Interpret and clarify specifications using analysis guidelines.

### Seminar 2: Design
- **Summary**: The second seminar involved designing the system under development by applying established guidelines for object-oriented architecture, design, and programming.
- **Learning Outcome**: Develop an object-oriented program focusing on quality architecture and design principles.

### Seminar 3: Implementation
- **Summary**: This seminar covered the programming and testing phases of the system under development, applying established guidelines for object-oriented architecture, design, and programming.
- **Learning Outcome**: Implement and test the system focusing on established object-oriented programming principles.

### Seminar 4: Exceptions and Design Patterns
- **Summary**: The fourth seminar was about implementing exception handling and using design patterns to enhance the system's architecture and design.
- **Learning Outcome**: Enhance program quality and functionality through the application of design patterns and exception handling.

Each seminar was designed to build on the knowledge from the previous ones, culminating in a comprehensive understanding of object-oriented program development, from analysis through implementation and refinement.
