# Projects

This section outlines the projects I've worked on as part of my ICT studies. Each project contributed to a comprehensive skill set in software development, from object-oriented design and programming to network communication and hardware interfacing.

## [IV1350 Object-Oriented Design Project](https://github.com/danaghafour/iv1350)

The course involved developing a single object-oriented program, reported in four different seminars, with each focusing on a distinct aspect of software development. Below is a summary of the project tasks for each seminar and a link to the repository where the project is hosted.

### Seminar Task 1: Analysis
- **Summary**: This seminar focused on creating a domain model and a system sequence diagram based on given specifications. It aimed at interpreting and clarifying a given specification by applying established guidelines for analysis.
- **Skills Developed**: Interpreting specifications, creating domain models, and system sequence diagrams through analytical techniques.

### Seminar Task 2: Design
- **Summary**: The second seminar involved designing the system under development by applying established guidelines for object-oriented architecture, design, and programming.
- **Skills Developed**: Object-oriented program design, applying principles of software architecture, and designing for quality and maintainability.

### Seminar Task 3: Implementation
- **Summary**: This seminar covered the programming and testing phases of the system under development, applying established guidelines for object-oriented architecture, design, and programming.
- **Skills Developed**: Implementing and testing object-oriented software, ensuring the application meets design specifications and functional requirements.

### Seminar Task 4: Exceptions and Design Patterns
- **Summary**: The fourth seminar was about implementing exception handling and using design patterns to improve the system's architecture and design.
- **Skills Developed**: Applying design patterns for problem-solving, implementing exception handling for reliability, and improve software quality and functionality.

Every seminar was created with the intention of building on the information covered in the previous ones, leading to a full comprehension of the development of object-oriented programs, from analysis to implementation and refinement.

## [ID1018 Programming I Assignments](https://github.com/danaghafour/ID1018)

The ID1018 course focuses on introductory programming tasks involving data manipulation, handling synonyms, and working with sequences of numbers. Here's a brief summary of each task and the skills developed.

### Task A1: Temperatures
- **Summary**: Develop a program to process temperature data, including finding the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures for each week and for the entire measurement period.
- **Skills Developed**: Working with arrays, and basic Java programming.

### Task A2: Synonyms
- **Summary**: Implement functionality to manage a collection of synonyms, including adding, removing, and sorting synonyms and their groups.
- **Skills Developed**: Data manipulation, string handling, and file I/O in Java.

### Task A3: Number Sequences
- **Summary**: Work with sequences of real numbers to determine upper and lower bounds, and identify if the sequences are increasing or decreasing.
- **Skills Developed**: Implementation of interfaces, use of arrays and linked lists, and understanding of sequences and bounds in programming.

These tasks provided hands-on experience with the foundational concepts of programming, including data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming in Java.

## [IS1200 Computer Hardware Engineering Project](https://github.com/danaghafour/IS1200)

### Mini Project: Pong Game Implementation
- **Summary**: This course introduced us to computer hardware engineering through a hands-on project where we developed a playable Pong game on the ChipKIT uC32 microcontroller. Demonstrating our ability to navigate hardware constraints, we applied game logic to enable both single and dual-player modes. On the integrated OLED graphical display, the gameplay—which included controlled paddles to hit a bouncing ball and score detection—was vividly displayed. This project demonstrated our ability to work with hardware and to creatively implement game mechanics within the constraints of the platform. 
- **Skills Developed**: Hardware programming, game development, input handling, and display output on a microcontroller platform.

## [IK1203 Network and Communication Project](https://github.com/danaghafour/IK1203)

This project series introduced networking concepts with a focus on TCP/HTTP protocols, client-server communication, and concurrent server design, utilizing Java.

### Task 1: TCPAsk
- **Summary**: Implemented a simple TCP client in Java to connect to a server, send data, and receive a response. This task focused on establishing a basic understanding of TCP socket programming.
- **Skills Developed**: Creation and use of TCP sockets for client-server communication, error handling, and binary data transmission.

### Task 2: TCPAsk Connections
- **Summary**: Enhanced the TCP client to handle different server communication protocols, including managing connection closures, timeouts, and data transfer limits.
- **Skills Developed**: Advanced TCP client functionalities, including connection management, timeouts, and data transfer limits.

### Task 3: HTTPAsk Server
- **Summary**: Developed an HTTP server that processes requests to dynamically configure and use the TCP client from Tasks 1 and 2, returning the output as an HTTP response.
- **Skills Developed**: HTTP request handling, server response generation, and query string parsing for dynamic TCP client configuration.

### Task 4: Concurrent HTTPAsk Server
- **Summary**: Modified the HTTPAsk server to support concurrent handling of multiple client requests using Java threading, allowing for parallel processing of incoming connections.
- **Skills Developed**: Multithreading for concurrent client handling, enhancing scalability, and responsiveness of network services.
