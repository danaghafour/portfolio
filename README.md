# Projects

This section outlines the projects I've worked on as part of my ICT studies. Each project contributed to a comprehensive skill set in software development, from object-oriented design and programming to network communication and hardware interfacing.

## [IV1350 Object-Oriented Design Project](https://github.com/danaghafour/iv1350)

The course involved developing a single object-oriented program, reported in five different seminars, with each focusing on a distinct aspect of software development. Below is a summary of the project tasks for each seminar and a link to the repository where the project is hosted.

### Seminar Task 1: Analysis
- **Summary**: This seminar focused on creating a domain model and a system sequence diagram based on given specifications. It aimed at interpreting and clarifying a given specification by applying established guidelines for analysis.
- **Skills Developed**: Interpreting specifications, creating domain models, and system sequence diagrams through analytical techniques.

### Seminar Task 2: Design
- **Summary**: The second seminar involved designing the system under development by applying established guidelines for object-oriented architecture, design, and programming.
- **Skills Developed**: Object-oriented program design, applying principles of software architecture, and designing for quality and maintainability.

### Seminar Task 3: Implementation
- **Summary**: This seminar covered the programming and testing phases of the system under development, applying established guidelines for object-oriented architecture, design, and programming.
- **Skills Developed**: Implementing and testing object-oriented software, ensuring the application meets design specifications and functional requirements.

### Seminar Task 4: Exceptions and Design Patterns
- **Summary**: The fourth seminar was about implementing exception handling and using design patterns to enhance the system's architecture and design.
- **Skills Developed**: Applying design patterns for problem-solving, implementing exception handling for robustness, and enhancing software quality and functionality.

Each seminar was designed to build on the knowledge from the previous ones, culminating in a comprehensive understanding of object-oriented program development, from analysis through implementation and refinement.

## [ID1018 Programming I Assignments](https://github.com/danaghafour/ID1018)

The ID1018 course focuses on introductory programming tasks involving data manipulation, handling synonyms, and working with sequences of numbers. Here's a brief summary of each task and the skills developed.

### Task A1: Temperatures
- **Summary**: Develop a program to process temperature data, including finding the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures for each week and for the entire measurement period.
- **Skills Developed**: Data analysis, working with arrays, and basic Java programming.

### Task A2: Synonyms
- **Summary**: Implement functionality to manage a collection of synonyms, including adding, removing, and sorting synonyms and their groups.
- **Skills Developed**: Data manipulation, string handling, and file I/O in Java.

### Task A3: Number Sequences
- **Summary**: Work with sequences of real numbers to determine upper and lower bounds, and identify if the sequences are increasing or decreasing.
- **Skills Developed**: Implementation of interfaces, use of arrays and linked lists, and understanding of sequences and bounds in programming.

These tasks provided practical experience with the foundational concepts of programming, including data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming in Java.

## [IS1200 Computer Hardware Engineering Project](https://github.com/danaghafour/IS1200)

This project allowed us to dive into the world of computer hardware engineering through the development and implementation of a Pong game on a PIC32 microcontroller, utilizing a ChipKIT Basic I/O Shield. The project aimed to showcase our ability to work with hardware, implement game logic, and develop a playable game that adheres to the constraints of the hardware platform.

### Mini Project: Pong Game Implementation
- **Summary**: Implemented a Pong game for the ChipKIT uC32 microcontroller. The game supports both one and two-player modes, with gameplay displayed on the built-in OLED graphical display. Players control paddles to hit a bouncing ball, with the game detecting scores and displaying the winning player.
- **Skills Developed**: Hardware programming, game development, input handling, and display output on a microcontroller platform.

The project was a comprehensive exercise in both hardware and software engineering, combining programming skills with an understanding of microcontroller capabilities and limitations. Through this project, we gained valuable experience in developing interactive applications on embedded systems.

## [IK1203 Network and Communication Project](https://github.com/danaghafour/IK1203)

This project series introduced networking concepts with a focus on TCP/HTTP protocols, client-server communication, and concurrent server design, utilizing Java.

### Task 1: TCPAsk
- **Summary**: Implemented a simple TCP client in Java to connect to a server, send data, and receive a response. This task focused on establishing a basic understanding of TCP socket programming.
- **Skills Developed**: Creation and use of TCP sockets for client-server communication, error handling, and binary data transmission.

### Task 2: TCPAsk Connections
- **Summary**: Enhanced the TCP client to handle different server communication protocols, including managing connection closures, timeouts, and data transfer limits.
- **Skills Developed**: Advanced TCP client functionalities, including connection management, timeouts, and data transfer limits.

### Task 3: HTTPAsk Server
- **Summary**: Developed an HTTP server that processes requests to dynamically configure and use the TCP client from Tasks 1 and 2, returning the output as an HTTP response.
- **Skills Developed**: HTTP request handling, server response generation, and query string parsing for dynamic TCP client configuration.

### Task 4: Concurrent HTTPAsk Server
- **Summary**: Modified the HTTPAsk server to support concurrent handling of multiple client requests using Java threading, allowing for parallel processing of incoming connections.
- **Skills Developed**: Multithreading for concurrent client handling, enhancing scalability, and responsiveness of network services.
